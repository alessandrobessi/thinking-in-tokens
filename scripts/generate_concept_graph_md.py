"""Generate concept-graph.md from concept-graph.yaml.

concept-graph.yaml is the source of truth. This script regenerates
concept-graph.md as an actual mirror of it (status, chapter, prerequisites,
misconception count, key-takeaway link) instead of a hand-maintained file
that can drift out of sync. Run this after any edit to concept-graph.yaml:

    python3 scripts/generate_concept_graph_md.py

Then commit both files together.
